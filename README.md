# python-blogging
#### Elijah Grubb

A simple blogging application built in python on top of the django framework. Functions as an example of my ability to build effective web applications as well as a place I can write about my experiences on.

It is live at [blog.grubbit.net](http://blog.grubbit.net).

At some point I hope to rewrite this readme with instruction on how you can easily clone this and get an empty version of my blog running for free on Heroku within an hour. Another day perhaps.
